/* CSS */
/* CSS or "Cascading Style Sheets" are how we can customize the style of our HTML elements. */
/* The basic idea is to first select the item or items you want to modify, and then apply properties to them to change their style */
/* 

Example using psuedocode (fake code):

htmlElementSelector {
    property1: value1;
    property2: value2;
    property3: value3;
}
*/

/* Example using real code: */

div {
  background-color: red;
  border-radius: 4px;
  color: black;
}

/* CSS SELECTORS */
/* The 3 main ones are as follows */
/* html element selector (just type in the name of the element */
p {
  color: orange;
}
